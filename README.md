# Moog
C++ program for Moog Hiring Team.

Why This Project?
This Spacecraft Control System project is a demonstration of my technical skills in C++ and my interest in combining software engineering with the intriguing challenges of space exploration. The project serves as a personal challenge to develop a dynamic, interactive application that simulates the control mechanisms of a spacecraft.

Key Points
Interest in Space Exploration: This project merges my passion for space with software development, aiming to simulate aspects of spacecraft navigation and control.
C++ and Object-Oriented Programming: Utilizes C++ to showcase object-oriented design principles for a clean, maintainable codebase.
Problem-Solving Skills: Reflects my approach to solving complex problems with clear, effective solutions.
Continued Growth: Represents my commitment to continuous learning and tackling new challenges.
Future Directions
While the current version of the project does not integrate external libraries, exploring the integration of libraries such as SFML for graphical representation and enhanced interaction is a considered next step. This addition would not only enhance the project's complexity but also expand its capability to simulate more realistic spacecraft control scenarios.

Conclusion
This project highlights my software development skills and my enthusiasm for exploring new challenges. It stands as a testament to my ability to conceive and execute complex projects, underscoring my potential value to a team and my ongoing pursuit of growth in the field of software engineering.
